# Node.js Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This Node.js program is a two-player implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. It's designed for beginners to practice fundamental JavaScript and server-side game development concepts.

## Key Concepts Explored:

**Functions:** Similar to Python, functions are used to organize code and make it reusable.
**Arrays:** The game board is represented using arrays, storing marks and providing access through indexes.
**Loops:** Loops iterate through arrays, building the game board and handling player turns.
**User Input:** The program uses modules like readline to capture user input through the terminal.
**Conditional Statements:** if/else statements control game flow, determine player turns, and check for winning conditions.
**Game Logic:** Similar to the Python version, the code tracks player turns and updates the game board accordingly.

### Running the Program:
- Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the file.
- Install the readline module using npm install readline.
- Run the program with node tic_tac_toe.js.

### Playing the Game:
Follow the prompts to enter row and column numbers (starting from 1) to place your marks (X or O).
The game continues until a player achieves three marks in a row, or the board is filled with no winner.

### Learning Outcomes:
By developing this program, you can gain hands-on experience with:
- JavaScript syntax and basic programming concepts.
- Using functions for code organization.
- Working with arrays to represent data structures.
- Implementing loops for repetitive tasks.
- Handling user input with Node.js modules like readline.
- Applying conditional statements for decision-making.
- Building simple game logic in a server-side environment.

### Enhancements:
- Add a winning condition check to determine the game's end.
- Implement player names for personalization.
- Use libraries like figlet or ascii-art to display a visual game board in the terminal.
- Explore AI algorithms to create a computer opponent using modules like minimax.
