# Python Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This Python program is a simple two-player implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. It's designed for beginners to practice fundamental Python concepts and game development.

## Key Concepts Explored:

**Functions: ** The code demonstrates how to define and use functions to organize code and make it reusable.
  
**Lists:** The game board is represented using lists, showcasing how to create, access, and modify elements within lists.

**Loops:** The code employs loops to iterate through rows and columns, building the game board and handling player turns.

**User Input:** The program takes user input to capture player moves, demonstrating interaction with users.

**Conditional Statements:** Conditional statements (if/else) are used to control game flow, determine player turns, and check for winning conditions.

**Game Logic:** While simple, the code introduces basic game logic concepts by tracking player turns and updating the game board accordingly.

### Running the Program:

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you saved the file.
Type python tic_tac_toe.py and press Enter.

### Playing the Game:
Follow the prompts to enter row and column numbers to place your marks (X or O).
The game continues until a player achieves three marks in a row, or the board is filled with no winner.

### Learning Outcomes:
By developing this program, you can gain hands-on experience with:

- Python syntax and basic programming concepts.
- Using functions for code organization.
- Working with lists to represent data structures.
- Implementing loops for repetitive tasks.
- Handling user input to make interactive programs.
- Applying conditional statements for decision-making.
- Building simple game logic.

### Enhancements:
- Add a winning condition check to determine the game's end.
- Incorporate player names for personalization.
- Implement a visual interface using libraries like Pygame for a more engaging experience.
- Explore AI algorithms to create a computer opponent.
